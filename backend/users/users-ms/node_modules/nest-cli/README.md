### Configuring the application

* Register a Nest application https://developers.nest.com/products/new

## Set Default Thermostat

To avoid the tedious task of entering in your thermostat device ID each time, you can mark a thermostat as the default.

List all devices linked to your account:

`nest-cli ls`

Once you determine which device you want to mark as your default:

`nest-cli default-thermostat <deviceId>`
